# Azure Network File Shares & Permissions Lab

This project showcases the practical implementation of network file sharing and robust permission management within a realistic Microsoft Azure environment. 

Designed to demonstrate a strong understanding of fundamental network administration principles crucial for a Helpdesk role, this lab simulates a small business network with Active Directory, a Windows Server, and a Windows 10 client machine.

The core focus is on effectively sharing resources over the network and configuring NTFS and share permissions to control access for individual mock users and groups. 

This hands-on experience demonstrates the ability to:

- Create and manage network file shares with varying levels of access (Read, Write, Deny).
- Implement and troubleshoot user and group-based permissions using Active Directory.
- Gain practical experience with Windows Server and Windows 10 in a domain-joined environment.
- Develop a foundational understanding of security best practices related to file sharing.
